  <h4>Database schema information:</h4>
  <p>
    All production related data is stored in the mysql database 'straub-callback_production' in the
    'marvin_callbacks' table. That table has the following columns:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>id - the unique id of the transaction, automatically generated by the database.</li>
    <li>raw_xml - the raw xml presented by the sender</li>
    <li>import_status - the parsed import status</li>
    <li>import_status_details - the parsed import status details</li>
    <li>guid - the UUID presented by the sender</li>
    <li>timestamp - the integer timestamp presented by the sender</li>
    <li>created_at - the actual time the transaction occured</li>
    <li>updated_at - the last time the record was changed. In this case this
      should always be the same as created_at</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    An example of a query for this database to get all transaction that occured on 9/1/2014:
    <br /><br />
    <code>
        SELECT * FROM marvin_callbacks WHERE DATE(created_at) = '2014-09-01';
    </code>
  </p>
